Using the CUnit framework, I tested key functionalities, including:
- Account creation and login
- Course registration management
- Admin and student roles
- CRUD operations on the database
The project involved testing critical components such as the app's backend logic, user verification, and security, ensuring comprehensive test coverage. I applied software testing techniques and standards that I learned during my diploma program and generated detailed reports on test results, software performance, and bugs. 🔍💻 

The project methodology included:
- MC/DC (Branch-Statement) coverage
- State transition coverage
- 3-level Boundary Value Analysis coverage

The techniques used were a combination of white box and functional testing.

The attached video contains the 3 phases of the testing process:
Phase 1: Planning (JIRA, Zephyr Scale) – writing test cases and test suites.
Phase 2: Applying the above methodologies and running CUnit.
Phase 3: Writing the reports.
